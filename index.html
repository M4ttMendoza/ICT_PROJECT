		Fire prevention is a function of many fire departments. The goal of fire prevention is to educate the public on the precautions which should be taken to prevent potentially harmful fires and how to survive these fires if they do occur. It is a proactive method of preventing fire-based emergencies and reducing the damage caused by them. Many fire departments have one or more Fire Prevention Officers, which may also be a routine duty of firefighters.

					Calling 911
				</td>
				<td class="text-justified">
					Make sure everyone in your home knows how to call 9-1-1 and give the dispatcher the address. Having families and friends know their home locations allow us to easily inform of the accident. And knowing the first call to action which is calling 9-1-1 decreases the likelihood of fires to spread and worsen. These can help one to avoid fires in the future.

					Keeping "Fire" Away
				</td>
				<td class="text-justified">
					Keep lit candles at least 12 inches from anything that can burn. Having candles, or any fire inducing material, away from inappropriate and unsafe areas, such as bedrooms, bathrooms, and others, decreases the chances of starting a fire. And knowing the proper ways in dealing with objects that are capable of fire also decreases the chances of fire. These can help us to avoid fires in the future.

					Cooking Safely
				</td>
				<td class="text-justified">
					Keep anything that can catch fire — paper towels, clothing, oven mitts, wooden utensils, food packaging, towels and curtains — away from your stovetop. Having proper precautions when cooking or using the stove decreases the chances of fire. This can help us to avoid fires in the future.

					Escape Plan
				</td>
				<td class="text-justified">
					Make a home escape plan. Draw a map of each level of your home. Show all doors and windows. Go to each room and point to the two ways out. Practice the plan with everyone in your household. Learning your home's insides and outs helps us in escaping the fire. Teaching the exits of your house to fellow friends and family also increases the chances of survival. These can help us to deal with fires in the future.

					Stop, Drop, and Roll
				</td>
				<td class="text-justified">
					If your clothes catch fire, stop, drop and roll. Stop, drop to the ground, and cover your face with your hands. Roll over and over or back and forth until the fire is out. If you cannot stop, drop and roll, keep a blanket or towel nearby to help you or others smother flames. Cover the person with a blanket to smother the fire. Knowing the proper procedure when we are in the face of fire increases your chances of survival. These can help us to deal with fires on hand in the future.
